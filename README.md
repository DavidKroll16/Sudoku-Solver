# Sudoku-Solver

After about a month focusing on learning python, a friend suggested I try to make a sudoku solver. He gave me the hint that I would 
need to use recursion to get the program to retrace its steps whenever it reached a deadend (a block where no number, 1-9, would 
fit). 

After a few days thinking, typing, scrapping, and debugging, this is what I came up with. 

Feel free to test it out! There is no front end component to this program, so to feed it to a sudoku puzzle, run the file in a terminal and type in the sudoku puzzle line by line, using '.' to represent empty spaces.
